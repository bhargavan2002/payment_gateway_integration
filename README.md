# About->
> I created a simple website with an integrated payment gateway. The homepage features a straightforward 'Donate' button. Upon clicking this button, users are directed to a payment page where they can select both the payment amount and the payment type, which includes Credit Card, Netbanking, Paypal, and Debit Card options. Upon successful payment, an invoice confirming the payment completion is generated on a new page.
